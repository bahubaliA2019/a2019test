   Chrome extension was installed manually (through developer mode )
   
   After enabling the extension there was some errors shown in the extension under errors
   There is no internet on the client system (only LAN)
   Automation.BrowserAgent.exe was not running even after enabling the extension ( that is the issue)
   We tried running it manually it was still not starting 
   
   We checked the regedit entry Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Google\Chrome\NativeMessagingHosts\automation.chrome.agent
   it was pointing to C:\ProgramData\AutomationAnywhere\GlobalCache\embedded-resources\2.0.4-20200422-175245-1825fd43-19bc-4dd2-ac56-53a2aed4b0e4\AAChromeAgentManifest.json

   There was no 11.x intstalled previously in the system
